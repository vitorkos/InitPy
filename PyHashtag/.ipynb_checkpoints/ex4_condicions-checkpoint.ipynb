    "- Create a system to be used by the stock control team of a distribution center.\n",
    "- Imagine that at the end of every day, the team counts how many units of product are in stock. If we have a stock below the stock allowed for that product category, the team must be notified (print) to place a new order for that product.\n",
    "- Each product category has a different minimum stock, according to the rule below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- food -> Minimum stock: 50\n",
    "- drinks -> Minimum stock: 75\n",
    "- cleaning -> Minimum stock: 30\n",

    "For this, we are going to create a program that asks for 3 inputs from the user: product name, category and current quantity in stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the product has less than the minimum stock for its category, the program should print the message \"Request {product} from the purchasing team, we only have {units} in stock\"\n",

    "Example: If the user fills in the inputs with: drinks, dolly, 90, the program must not display any message.<br>\n",
    "Now, if the user fills in the inputs with: drinks, guaraná, 60, the program should display the message \"Request guaraná from the purchasing team, we only have 60 units in stock.\n",

    "Note: remember to use int() to transform the number entered by the user in the string input to int.<br>\n",
    "Obs2: If the user does not fill in any of the 3 pieces of information, the program must display a message to warn him to fill in correctly."
